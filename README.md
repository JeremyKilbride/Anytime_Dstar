# Anytime and Incremental Algorithms for Unknown Environments
Authors: Evan Wassmann, Trevor Stack, Jeremy Kilbride

This Repository is for our final project in CMU 16-782 Robot Planning and Decision Making. For our project we implemented Anytime D*, Anytime Repairing A*, and D* lite for efficiently re-planning in unknown environments. References for these algorithms are below
